            Chemical engineering is a branch of engineering that uses principles of chemistry, physics, mathematics,
            biology, and economics to efficiently use, produce, design, transport and transform energy and materials.
            The work of chemical engineers can range from the utilisation of nano-technology and nano-materials in the
            laboratory to large-scale industrial processes that convert chemicals, raw materials, living cells,
            microorganisms, and energy into useful forms and products.

            Chemical engineers are involved in many aspects of plant design and operation, including safety and hazard
            assessments, process design and analysis, modeling, control engineering, chemical reaction engineering,
            nuclear engineering, biological engineering, construction specification, and operating instructions.

            Chemical engineers typically hold a degree in Chemical Engineering or Process Engineering. Practising
            engineers may have professional certification and be accredited members of a professional body. Such bodies
            include the Institution of Chemical Engineers (IChemE) or the American Institute of Chemical Engineers
            (AIChE). A degree in chemical engineering is directly linked with all of the other engineering disciplines,
            to various extents.

        <h4>USP</h4>
        <p>he University of São Paulo (Portuguese: Universidade de São Paulo, USP) is a public university in the Brazilian state of São Paulo. It is the largest Brazilian public university and the country's most
        prestigious educational institution,[3][4] the best university in Ibero-America,[5][6][7] and holds a high
        reputation among world universities, being ranked 100 worldwide in reputation by the Times Higher Education
        World University Rankings.[8][9][10] USP is involved in teaching, research and university extension in all
        areas of knowledge, offering a broad range of courses.

        The university was founded in 1934, regrouping already existing schools in the state of São Paulo, such as
        the Faculdade de Direito do Largo de São Francisco (Faculty of Law), the Escola Politécnica (Engineering
        School) and the Escola Superior de Agricultura Luiz de Queiroz (College of Agriculture). The university's
        foundation is marked by the creation in 1934 of the Faculdade de Filosofia, Ciências e Letras (Faculty of
        Philosophy, Sciences and Letters, 1934-1968), and has subsequently created new departments, becoming one of
        the largest institutions of higher education in Latin America, with approximately 90,000 enrolled students.
        Currently, it has eleven campuses, four of them in the city of São Paulo.[11] The remaining campuses are in
        the cities of Bauru, Lorena, Piracicaba, Pirassununga, Ribeirão Preto and two in São Carlos.

        Several students from the University of São Paulo have achieved important positions in Brazilian society. It
        was the alma mater of twelve Brazilian presidents. USP was ranked 19th worldwide in a rank based on the
        number of alumni who became CEOs in the world's 500 largest companies,[12] and also classed in the top 100
        worldwide in the Global Employability University Ranking.[13] In terms of research, USP is Brazil's largest
        research institution, producing more than 25% of the scientific papers published by Brazilian researchers in
        high quality conferences and journals.[14] In 2015, out of 36 subjects, the QS World University Rankings
        ranked USP in the top 50 in eight subjects (including Architecture, Dentistry, Civil Engineering,
        Agriculture/Forestry, Art/Design and Veterinary Science) and in the top 51-100th position in 21 more
        subjects (including Computer Science, Mechanical, Electrical and Chemical Engineering, Modern Languages,
        Geography, Physics, Chemistry and Mathematics). Over the years, QS also consistently ranked USP among the
        top 5 universities in the Latin world. </p>
        <h4>Computer Science</h4>
        <p>
            Computer programming is the process of designing and building an executable computer program to accomplish a
            specific computing result. Programming involves tasks such as: analysis, generating algorithms, profiling
            algorithms' accuracy and resource consumption, and the implementation of algorithms in a chosen programming
            language (commonly referred to as coding).[1][2] The source code of a program is written in one or more
            languages that are intelligible to programmers, rather than machine code, which is directly executed by the
            central processing unit. The purpose of programming is to find a sequence of instructions that will automate
            the performance of a task (which can be as complex as an operating system) on a computer, often for solving
            a given problem. The process of programming thus often requires expertise in several different subjects,
            including knowledge of the application domain, specialized algorithms, and formal logic.

            Tasks accompanying and related to programming include: testing, debugging, source code maintenance,
            implementation of build systems, and management of derived artifacts, such as the machine code of computer
            programs. These might be considered part of the programming process, but often the term software development
            is used for this larger process with the term programming, implementation, or coding reserved for the actual
            writing of code. Software engineering combines engineering techniques with software development practices.
            Reverse engineering is the opposite process. A hacker is any skilled computer expert that uses their
            technical knowledge to overcome a problem, but it can also mean a security hacker in common language.
